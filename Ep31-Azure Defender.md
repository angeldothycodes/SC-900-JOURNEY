Azure Defender is a built-in tool that provides threat protection for workloads running in Azure, on-premises, and other clouds. Defender is the leading Microsoft Extended Detection and Response Solution (**XDR**) for threat protection.

Azure Defender protects your hybrid data, cloud native services and servers, and integrates with your existing security workflows.


## Azure Defender

Azure Defender comes with several different plans that can be enabled separately and will run simultaneously to provide a comprehensive defense or compute data and service layers in your environment.

The Azure Defender plans are:


**> Azure Defender for Servers**
- This adds threat detection and advanced detection for your Windows and Linux Machines


**> Azure Defender for App Service**
- This uses cloud scale to identify attacks targeting applications running over app service


**> Azure Defender for Storage**
- This detects potentially harmful activity on your Azure Storage accounts. This data can be detected whether stored on a block container, file shares, or data lakes.


**> Azure Defender for SQL**
- This extends Azure Security Center data security package to secure your databases and their data wherever they are located


**> Azure Defender for Kubernetes**
- This provides the best cloud natives kubernetes security environment hardening, workload protection, and runtime protection


**> Azure Defender for Container Registries**
- This helps you protect all the Azure Resource Manager base registries in your subscription. Azure Defender Scans all images pushed to your registry or imported into the registry or any images pulled within the last 30 days


**> Azure Defender for Key Vault**
- This is an Azure native service. Advanced Threat protection for Azure Key Vault provide an extra layer for your security intelligence

Another capability of Azure Defender is its hybrid cloud protection. It can defend Azure environment and add Azure Defender capabilities to the hybrid cloud environment. This include protecting non-azure servers and protecting virtual machines in other cloud including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

To focus on what matters most, threat intelligence can be customized and prioritize alerts according to specific environment.


## Azure Defender Alerts, Advanced Protection, Vulnerability Assessment

**Azure Defender Alerts**
- When Azure Defender detects a threat in any area of your environment, it generates an alert. These alerts describe details of the affected resources, suggested remediation steps, and in some cases, an option to trigger a logic app in response. The alerts can also be exported into Azure Sentinel.


**Advanced Protection**
- Azure Defender uses advanced analytics for tailored recommendations as they relate to your resources. These analytics might include securing the management port of your VMs with just-in-time access and adaptive application to create allow list for what app should and shouldn't run on your machines.


**Vulnerability Assessment**
- Azure Defender includes vulnerability scanning for your virtual machine and container registries. You can review these findings from these vulnerability scanners and respond to them all from within the Azure Security center.




Estate security is an essential part of every organization. Without these tools protecting your organization's data, resources, and assets, it would be difficult. You would require multiple layers of overlapping third-party softwares and there would be an overhead of extra maintenance with no guarantee of complete protection.
