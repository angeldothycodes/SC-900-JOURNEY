Identity governance is concerned with balancing identity security with user productivity in a way that can be justified and audited.

Azure AD provides many identity protection and governance capabilities including privileged identity management, identity protection, and terms of use statements.

**Azure AD Identity Governance** gives organizations the ability to govern the ientity lifecycle, govern access lifecycle, secure pivileged access for administration.
These actions can be completed for employees, business partners, and vendors and across services and applications both on-premises and in the cloud. 

It is intended to help organizations address these four key questions:

>> Which users should have access to which resources

>> What are those users doing with that access

>> Are there effective organizational controls for managing access

>> Can auditors verify that the controls are working


When planning the identity lifecycle management for employees, for example, may organizations model join, move, and leave processes.

When an individual first joins an organization, a new digital identity is created if one isn't already available. When an individual moves between organizational boundaries, more access authorizations may need to be added or removed to their digital identity. When an individual leaves, access may need to be removed and the identity might no longer be required othen than for audit purposes.

**Entitle Management** is an identity governance feature that enables organizations to manage identity and access lifecycle at scale. Entitle management automate access request workflows, access assignments, reviews, and expiration.

Regular access reviews ensures that only the right people have access to the resources. Excessive access rights are a known security risk. However when people move between teams, take on or relinquish responsibilities, access rights can be difficult to control.
Access reviews are helpful when you have too many users in privileged roles such as a global administrator or when automation is impsossible such as when HR data isn't in Azure Active Directory.


### Azure AD Terms of Use

Employees or guests can be required to accept terms of use before they access sensitive data or an application or on a recurring schedule so they are reminded of regulations or when terms of use are required in different languages.
