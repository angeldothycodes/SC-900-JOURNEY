Protecting an organization's estate, resources, assets, and data from security breaches and attack is an ongoing and escalating challenge. Recently, the business world changed almost overnight as many staffs switches to remote working. This created an exploitable window for cyber criminals. IT departments rushed to patch and strengthened their staffs' devices and their acess to companies assets and resources.


Cyber criminals will often escalate their activity in times of national or global crisis looking to exploit the situation and find ways into your organization. Having a resilient and robust industry standard set of tool can help mitigiate and prevent those exploits. 

Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automated Response (SOAR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) provide excellent security insights and security automation that can enchance an organization's network security perimeter.


**What is SIEM?**

A SIEM system is a tool that an organization uses to collect data from across the whole estate including infrastructure, software, and resources. It does analysis, look for correlations or anomalies and generates alerts and incidents 


**What is SOAR?**
A SOAR system takes alert from many sources such as SIEM system.The SOAR system then triggers action-driven automated workflows and processes to run security tasks that mitigate the issue.


**What is XDR?**
An XDR us designed to deliver intelligent, automated, and integrated security across an organization's domain. It helps prevent, detect, and respond to threat across identities, endpoints, applications, email, IoT infrastructure, and cloud platforms. 


**To provide a comprehensive security perimeter, an organization need to use a solution that embraces or combines all of these solutions.**

Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable cloud native SIEM or SOAR solution that delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise.
It provides a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response. 
Azure Sentinel collects data at cloud scale across all users' devices, applications, and infrastructure both on-premises and in multiple clouds.

You can use Azure Sentinel to detect previously uncovered threats and minimize false positives using analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence. Azure Sentinel can investigate threats with AI and hunt suspicious activities at scale. Tapping into decades of cybersecurity work at Microsoft, Azure Sentinel can also be used to respond to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common security tasks.
