**Authentication** is the process of verifying an identity to be legitimate. Legacy applications have relied on a single form of authentication and most often, a password. However, passwords are problematic for users and easy to be compromsied.
**Multi-factor AUthentication (MFA)** requires more than one form of verification to prove that an identity is legitimate so that means that even when an identity password has been compromised, a hacker cannot gain entry to a resource.

An MFA prompts are configrued to be part of your Azure Active Directory sign-in event. Azure Active Directory automtacillay requests and processes multi-factor authentication without you making any changes to your applications or services. When a user signs in, they receive a multi-factor authentication prompt and choose from one of the additional verification forms that they have registered.
