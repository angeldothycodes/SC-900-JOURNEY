Security threat prevention is not limited to just network security. It also covers applications, email collaborations, endpoints, core SaaS solutions, identity and more.

With the integrated Microosft365 defender solution, security professionals can stitch together the threat signals that each of these products receive and determine the full scope of the impact of the threat- how it entered the environment, what it's affected, and how it's currently impacting the organization.
