Privileged Identity Management (**PIM**) is an Azure Active Directory service that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to essential resources in your organization.


Why someone should use **Priveleges Identity Management?** Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources beacuse that reduces the chance of a malicious actors getting resources or unauthenticated user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource.


However, users still need to carry out privilege operations in Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, all SaaS-based applications so organizations can give users Just In Time privilege access to Azure and Azure AD resources and can oversee what those users are doing with their privilege access.


**PIM** mitigates the risk of excessive and unnecessary or misused access permissions.

It requires justification to understand why users want permissions and enforces multi-factor authentication to activate any role.

PIM also provides oversight for what users are doing with their user administrative privileges.

PIM mitigates the risk of organizations of elevated privileges.
