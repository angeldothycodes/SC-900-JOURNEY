Organization needs to protect all sorts of information including financial and personal information. This must be done to ensure customers, employees, and the organization are protected from risk. The organziation needs to stay in line with the compliance standards wherever it operates.

Microsoft provides solutions that can help organization to implement information protection and governance.


# Microsoft Information Governance

Microsoft Information Governance manages your content lifecycle using solution to import, store, and classify business critical so you can keep what you need and delete what you don't. It gives the organziations the capabilities to govern their date for compliance or regulatory requirements.

Microsoft Information Protection and Microsoft Information Governance work together to classify, protect, and keep your data where it lives and wherever it goes.


**1.** The first step organization need to do is **know your data**. Organizations can understand their data landscape and identify important data across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.

Capabilities and tools such as trainable classifiers, activity explorer, and content explorer allow organization to know their data. 


**2.** Second step is to **protect your data**. Organizations can apply flexible protection actions including encryption, access restrictions, and visual markings.

**3.** Third step is to **prevent data loss**. Organziations can detect risky behavior and prevent accidental oversharing of sensitive information. Capabilities such as data loss prevention policies and endpoint data loss prevention enable organizations to avoid data loss

**4.** Final step is to **govern your data**. Organizations can automatically keep, delete, and store data and records in a compliant manner. Capabilities like retention policies, retention labels, and record management enable organizations to govern their data.


## Data classification capabilities

**Data classification capabilities of Compliance Center:**

1. **Sensitive Information Type.** With Microsoft 365 Compliance Center, admins can identify and protect sensitive information types. Sensitive information type have set patterns that can be used to identify them. For example, an identification number in a region or country may be based on a specific pattern. Some examples include credit card numbers, passport or identification numbers, bank account numbers, health service numbers, etc.

2. **Trainable classifiers.** It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to intelligently classify your data. There are two types of classifiers: retrained classifiers and custom trainable classifiers

3. **Understand and explore the data.** Data classification can involve large numbers of documents and emails. To help administrators to easily derive insights and understanding, the overview section of the data classification pane in the compliance center provides many details at glance.

Organizations must protect their data to safeguard customers and business operations and to meet compliance standards. Admins can enable their organization to protect its data through capabilities and tools such as **Sensitivity labels and policies** in Microsoft 365 compliance center.

Sensitivity labels are available as part of information protection in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. This enables the labeling and protection of content without affecting productivity and collaboration. These labels include customizable clear text and persistent. After sensitivity labels are created, they need to be published to make them available to people and service in the organization.

Sensitivity labels are publsihed to users or groups through label policies. And Sensitivity label will then appear in Office apps for those users and groups.
