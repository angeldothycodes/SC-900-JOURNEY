**Azure Identity protection** is a tool that allows organizations to accomplish three key task. 

> The first task is automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risk

> Second task is investigate risk using data in the portal

> Third main task is export risk detection data to third-party utilities for further analysis


Microsoft analyzes 6.5 trillion signals per day to identify potential threats. These signals come from Azure AD, Microsoft account, and Xbox accounts.

The signals generated by these services are fed to identity protection so they can be used by tools such as **Conditional Access** which uses identity protection signals to make access decisions.

These signals are also fed to security information and even management tools as well such as Sentinel for further investigation. 

Identity protection categorizes risk into three tiers: **low**, **medium**, and **high**. Additionally, it can calculate the sign-in risk and user identity risk as well.

**What is sign-in risk?**

**Sign-in risk** is the probability that the sign-in wasn't performed by the user.
