**Confidentiality** refers to keep confidential, sensitive data such as customer information, passwords, or financial data. You can encrypt data to keep it confidential. You also need to keep the encryption keys confidential.
Confidentiality is the most visible part of security. We can clearly see sensitive data, keys, passwords, and other secrets to be kept confidential


**Integrity** refers to keeping data or messages correct. When you send an email message, you want to make sure that the message received is the same message you have sent. When you store data in a database, you want to be sure that the data you retrieve is the same data you have stored.
Encrypting data keeps it confidential but you must be able to decrypt it so that it's the same as before it was encrypted.
