One way to mitigate against common cybersecurity threat is to encrypt sensitive and valuable data.

**Encryption** is the process of making data unreadable and unusable to unauthorized viewers. To use encrypted data, it must be decrypted which requires the use of security key and the next thing we are going to learn about this lesson is **hashing**

**Hashing** is the process of transforming any given key or a string of numbers into another value. 

The next topic we are going to learn is digital signature or signing. **Digital signature** is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of digital messages or documents

**Asymmetric** encryption is used for things like transport layered security which is known as **TLS** such as https protocol and data signing.

**Encryption** may protect data at rest or in transit.

When it comes to encryption, we need to understand two concepts:
**Encryption ate Rest** and **Encryption in Transit**


**Data at rest** is the data that's stored on a physical device such as a serrver. It may be stored in a database or a storage account but regardless of where it is stored, encryption of data at rest ensures that the data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to decrypt it


**Data in transit** is the data moving from one location to another such as across the internet or through a private network. Secure transfer can be handled by several different layers. It can be done by encrypting the data at the application layer before sending it over a network. Https is an example of encryption in transit. Encrypting data in transit protects it from outside and provides a mechanism to transmit data while limiting risk of exposure
