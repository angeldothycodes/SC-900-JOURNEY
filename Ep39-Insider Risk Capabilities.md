> It starts with understanding **policies**. Insider risk amangement policies are created using predefined templates and policy conditions that define wahat risk indicators are examined in Microsoft 365 feature areas


> The next one is **alerts**. Alerts are automatically generated by risk indicatiors that match policy conditions and are displayed in the alerts dashboard


> **Triage**. New activities that need investigation automatically generate alerts that are assigned a need review status. Reviewers in the organiation can quickly identify these alerts and scroll through each of these to evaluate and triage


> Next stage is **investigation**, cases are created for alerts that require deeper review and investigation for the details and circumstances around the policy match


> Final stage, **Action**. After cases are investigated, reviewers can quickly act to resolve the case or collaborate with other risk stakeholders in the organization.

Communication compliance in Microsoft365 compliance center helps minimize communication risk by enabling organization to detect, capture, and take remediation actions for inappropriate messages. Identifying and resolving compliance issue with communciation compliance in M365 uses the following workflow. 

**1. It start with "Configure". In this step, admins identify compliance requirements and configure applicable communication compliance policies**

**2. The next step is investigate. This is where admins look into the issues dected when matching your communication compliance policies.**

**3. The next step is remediate. This is where you will remediate communications compliance issue.**

**Information Barriers** are policies that admins can configure to prevent individuals or group from communiating with each other. When information barrier policies are in place, people who shouldn't communicate with other specific users can't find, select, chat, or call those users.

With ifnroamtion barriers, checks are in place to prevent unauthorized communication.

In Microsoft teams, information barrier policies determine and prevent the following kind of unauthorized communications:

**Privileged Access Management** allows granular access control over pivileged admin tasks in Microsoft 365. It can help organizations from breaches that use existing privileged admin accounts with standing access to sensitive data or access to critical configuration settings. 

Enabling privileged access management in M365 allows organizations to operate with zero standing access. This means that any user who needs privileged access must request permission for access and will receive only the level of acess they need just when they need it and with just enough access to perform the job at hand.
