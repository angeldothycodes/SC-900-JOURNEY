**Defense in Depth** is a security risk management approach that defines multiple layers of security controls in an IT environment so that if a security attack is not caught by one layer, it will probably be caught by the next one.

The multiple layers increase the overall security score of your environment and reduce the probability of a security breach by a huge margin.

**Defense in Depth** uses a layered approach to security rather than relying on a single perimeter.
A Defense in Depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack or an attacker.

Each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer will prevent an attacker getting unauthorized access to data.

The security measure that you need to take on each layer:

- **Physical layer**. How can you add extra security to your physical layer? The physical security provide a limiting access to a data center to only authorized personnel

- **Identity and Access Security** controlling access to infrastructure and change control.

- **Perimeter Security** including DDoS protection to filter large scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users

- **Network Security** can limit communication between resources using segmentation and access control

- **Compute** layer can secure access to virtual machines either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports

- **Application** layer security ensures that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities

- **Data** layer security controls access to business and customer data and encryption to protect data


With the rapid expansion of cloud computing, the need for defense in depth strategy has increase many folds. Microsoft provides a powerful set of tools and features within Microsoft Azure and 365 platforms to protect security in every layer
