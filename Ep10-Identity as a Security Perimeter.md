Enterprise esecurity needs to adapt to its new reality. The Security perimeter can no longer be viewed as the on-premises network. It now extend to SaaS applications for business critical workload that may be hosted outside the corporate network or the personal devices that employees are using to access corporate resources which include **BYOD(Bring Your Own Device)** while working from home. The other concern is the unmanaged devices used by partners or customers when interacting with corporate data or collaborating with employees.

Another concern is IoT devices installed throughout your coporate network and inside customer locations. The traditional perimeter-based security model is no longer enough. 

**Identity** has become the new security parameter that enables organization to secure their assets. But what do you mean by an **identity**? 


**Identity** is how someone or something can be verified and authenticated to be who they say they are. An **identity** may be associated with a user, an application, a device, or something else.


#### Four Pillars of identity

- **Administration** is about the creation and management of identities for users, devices, and services. As an administrator, you manage how and under what circumstances the characteristics of identities can change, be created, updated, or deleted.


- **Authentication** pillar tells the story of how much assurance for a particular identity is enough. In other words, how much does an IT system need to know about an identity in order to have sufficient proof that they really are who they say they are. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials. Authentication is sometimes shortened to known as **auth**


- **Authorization** pillar is about processing the incoming identity data to determine the level of access an authenticated person or service have within the application or service that it wants to access.


- **Auditing** pillar is about tracking who does what, when, where, and how. Auditing includes having in-depth reporting alerts and governance of identities.


Addressing each of these four pillars are key to a comprehensive and robust identiy and access control solution.


Enterprise must walk the fine line between enterprise control and granting access permissions to individuals.The result is that identity become the new security perimeter. Only identity can be both enable organization to secure resources whie giving end users the convenience and ease of use they seek.
