Security center continually assess your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so you can quickly see your current security situation. The higher the score, the lower the identified risk.


The secure score is shown in portal page as a percentage value. The underlying values are also clearly presented. To increase your security and raise your score, review security center's recommendation page for the outstanding actions necessary and each recommendation includes instructions to help you remediate the specific issue.

Every control in the recommendations list shows the potential secure score increase if you address the underlying problem. To get every possible security control point, all your resources must follow each security recommendation within the security control.

For example, security center has multiple recommendations for how to secure your management ports, you must remediate them all to make a difference in your security score.
