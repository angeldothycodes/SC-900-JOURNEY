**Password Protection** is a feature of Azure Active Directory which reduces the risk of users sending weak passwords. 

Azure AD Password Protection detects and block known weak passwords and their variants and can also block additional weak terms that are specific to your organization.

**Global banned password list** is automatically applied and cannot be disabled.

**Custom banned password list**. In the passowrd protection, you can enable the custom list. This is where you will be able to provide additional passwords.
Admins can create custom banned password list to support specific business security needs.
The custom banned password list prohibits passwords such as the organization name or location. 
The custom banned password is list combined with the global banned passwords list to block variations of all the passwords. 
Banned password lists are a feature of Azure AD premium 1 and premium 2. 

Another feature of Azure Active Directory password protection is protecting against the password spray. Azure AD password protection helps defend against password spray attacks. Most password spray attacks submit a small number of known biggest passwords against each of the accounts in an enterprise.
This technique allows to quickly search for an easily compromised account and avoid potential detection thresholds. 
Azure AD Password Protection effectively blocks all known weak password likely to be used in password spray attacks.
This protection is based on real world security telemetry data from Azure Active Directory which is used to build the global band password list and it does provide hybrid security as well.
For Hybrid Security, admins can integrate Azure AD password protection with an on-premises active directory environment. A component installed in the on-prem environment receives the global band passowrd list and custom password protection policies from Azure ACtive Directory, domain controllers then use them to process password change events.
This hybrid approach make sure that whenever a user changes their password, Azure AD password protection is applied.



**Although password protection improves the strength of the passwords, you should still use best practices like Azure Active Directory multi-factor authentication. Passwords alone, even strong ones, are not as secure as multiple layers of security.**
