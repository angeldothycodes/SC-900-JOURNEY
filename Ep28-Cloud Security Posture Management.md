Cloud-based systems are continually evolving and changing as companies move away from on-premises to the cloud. This move make it difficult for any IT department to know if your data assets and other resources are fully protected as they used to be. Even a small misconfiguration of a new feature can increase the attack surface available for cybercriminals to exploit.

# CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)

CSPM is a relatively new class of tools designed to improve  your cloud security management. It assesses your security and automatically alers security staff in your IT department when a vulnerability is found.

CSPM uses tools and services in your cloud environment to monitor and prioritzie security enhancements and features.

**CSPM uses a combination of tools and services:**

**1. Zero trust-based access control**

This considers the active threat level during access control decisions

**2. Real-time risk scoring**

This is to provide visbility into top risk

**3. Threat and vulnerability management (TVM)**

This establishes a holistic view of the organization's attack surface and integrate it into operations and engineering decision-making

**4. Disocver sharing risks**

This is done to understand the data exposure of enterprise intellectual property on sanctioned and unsactioned cloud services

**5. Technical policy**

So you can apply guardrails ato audit and enforce the organization standard and policies to technical systems

**6. Threat modeling systems & architectures**

This is used alongside other specific applications


The main goal of cloud security team working on posture management is continuously report on and improve the organization security posture by focusing on disrupting a potential attacker's return on investment .

The function of CSM in your organization might be spread across multiple teams or there may be a dedicated team. 


**CSPM can be useful in many teams in your organization which include:**

**> Threat intelligence team**

**> Information technology**

**> Compliance & risk management teams**

**> Business leaders and SMEs**

**> Security architecture and operations**

**> Audit team**
