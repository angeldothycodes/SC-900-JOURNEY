NEtwork securty is ever changing and shifting battleground where a moment's hesitation can allow cyber criminals to compromise your security perimeter and steal vulnerable assets and resources.

Using Azure Security center gives your infrastructure alevel of security management to protect your data.

## Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center provides the tools you need to harden your network, secure services, and ensure you are on top of your security posture.

Azure Security Center addresses the three most urgent security challenges:

**1. Rapidly changing workloads**

As organizations emplower users to do more, the challenge is to ensure that the ever changing services people use and create meet your security standards and follow best practices.

**2. Increasingly sophisticated attacks**

Wherever your work is situated, the attacks keep getting more sophisticated. Securing your public internet-facing services is essential. Otherwise, you will be even more vulnerable 

**3. Security skills are in short supply**

The number of security alerts and alerting systems far outnumbers the total of administrators who have necessary background and experience to ensure your environment are protected

To help against these challenges, **Azure Security center** provide tools to strengthen your posture, protect against threat and get secure faster.

You can improve your security posture using Azure Security Center to identify and perform hardening task across your machines, data services, and applications.
With Azure Security Center, you can manage and enforce security policies to ensure compliance across your virtual machines, non-Azure servers, and Azure pass services.

Security center brings continuous assessment of your entire estate, discovering and reporting whether new and existing resources and assets are configured according to security compliance requirements.

You will get an ordered list of recommendations of what needs to be fixed to maintain maximum protection and security center groups these recommendation into security controls and add a security score value to each control. This process is crucial in enabling you to prioritize security work.


## Network Map

One of the most powerful security center tools for continuously monitoring the security status of your network is the **Network Map**. Use the map to look at the topology of your workloads so you can see if each node is properly configured. You can see how your node are connected which helps you block unwanted connections that could potentially make it easier for an attacker to creep along your network.

Security Center helps get secure faster. With Security center, organizations can secure faster through integration with other Microsoft Security Solutions. Also, integration with Azure and its resources means you will put together a complete Security story involving Azure policy and built-in Security Center policies across all your Azure resources. We then ensure that the whole thing is automatically applied to newly discovered resources as you create them in Azure.


Security Center protects non-azure servers and virutal machines in the cloud or on-premises for both Windows and Linux servers by installing the log analytics agent. Meanwhile, Azure Virtual machines are auto-provisioned in the Security Center.
