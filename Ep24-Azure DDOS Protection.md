The aim of Distributed Denial of Service or DDos Attack is to overwhelm the resource on your application and server making them unresponsive or slow for genuine users.

A DDoS attack will usually target any public facing endpoint that can be accessed through the internet. There are three most popular type of Distributed Denial of Service attack. 

**1. Volumetric attacks**
**2. Protocol attacks**
**3. Resource (application) layer attacks**


## Volumetric Attacks
These are volume-based attacks that flood the network with seemingly legitimate traffic. Overwhelming the available bandwidth, legitimate traffic isn't able to get through. These types of attacks are emasured in bits-per-seconds.



## Protocol Attacks
Protocol attacks render a target inaccessible by exhausting server resources with false protocol requests that exploit weakness in layer 3 network and layer 4 protocols. These types of attacks are typically measured in packets per second.



## Resource or Application Layer Attacks

 These attacks target web application packets to disrupt the transmission of data between the host
